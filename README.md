Commit strategy
- Commit in logical blocks
- Commit should not contain errors or faulty code
- Commit naming: short and concise

# Conventions

## Casing
- Classes: PascalCase
	- Private fields: _camelCase, noun
	- Properties: PascalCase, noun
	- Methods: PascalCase, verb
	- Local variables: camelCase
- Interfaces: IPascalCase
- Constants: CAPITAL_LETTERS

## Structure
- Every class (struct, enum, record...) in its own file
	- Try to keep files small (it should fit on the screen)
	- Try to keep methods small (under 10 lines if possible)
- Use tab for indentation
- All braces will be on their own line
